# LightHub

## Executive Summary
This documentation is to serve as a 'Statement of Work' or SOW for developing a light controller to enhance and empower end user screen time. The advancement in the field of IoT, Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can help business. Such a system would include a means to capture, catalogue and analyze data, along with tools to enforce 'business logic'.

## Introduction
A Lightning solution for assisting you to control your screen time by alerting in an more adaptive and cheerful way. It is a plug & play solution which consist of an USB cable and our main controller which monitor your screen time while you use your computer. Main Idea behind this to take control over our long hours of working infront of our computer screen without resting our eyes which causes problem in a long run.

Ashtam Singh will work with IdeaUsher to:

* Developing the architecture for connecting and controlling the LED controller.
* Developing the Firmware for the controller.
* Designing PCB for the controller.
* Developing the software for controlling the device.
* Develop and Engineer the system.
* Provide documentation of the new system.
* Knowledge Transfer/Integrate with IdeaUsher.

Ashtam Singh proposes to design, develop and provide installation of v1.0 of the proposed system to IdeaUsher.
This activity will require 6 weeks.

The Value Proposition of working with Ashtam Singh for this project are:
* Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.
* Leveraging his experience in working with IoT toolkit (ESP) to bootstrap your effort. 
* Using subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost-saving quickly.

## Deliverables

* Device Firmware - 
  A base code which runs on the controller which helps in bring out the functionality of this controller.
```
Feedback:           LED
Data to Capture:    Audio/Sound
```

* PCB Design - 
  Designing a pcb for the controller for manufacturing.
```
Deliverables:       Gerber Files
                    BOM
                    Schematics
```

* Admin SDK / APIs for Devices - Software
Native packages to interact with the devices.
GUI from where end user can able to configure the time when to alert, react to nearby sound.

* Documentation for the proposed changes in the system.
## Maintenance (if required)
The period after the development for maintaining the product to be discussed with the Client as it incurred extra charges.

## Exclusions
The followings are excluded from the project scope
* The packages used and maintained by Ashtam Singh for interfacing with IoT Devices.

## Investment and Cost

* Hardware required: On Cost  : 
    * Sensory Devices: TBD
    * MCU: TBD
    
* Server/Web hosting charges:
    * 60$ / month = 4000 INR

*Bill separately for travel costs will be billed at actual cost and will not exceed 10,000 INR for the entire project.

 * Payment Schedule

| Milestone                                 | Percentage    | Amount (USD)    |

| Requirement Finalization + Full working details                  | 30%            | $454 |
| First working prototypes                  | 50%           | $756 |
| Final Delivery + Software handoaver                         | 20%          | $303 |


Devices/Sensors cost to be paid on the day of requirement finalization.
Server cost to be paid directly or at the start of each month.
Travel reimbursements as and when declared.

## Customer Responsibilities
* The nature of this engagement dictates that Ashtam Singh receive a frequent and enthusiastic response from the appropriate personnel.
* A weekly review between the Ashtam Singh and the IdeaUsher or his designate will ensure that the expectations of this engagement are met.
* Client will assign a key contact who will be responsible for providing Ashtam Singh with information, access to personnel, and facility access if required.
* Client will provide a work area space with desk, chair, Internet access for use by Ashtam Singh to conduct project business while working on-site.

## Acceptance Criteria
After this evaluation, all deliverables for this phase will be presented to IdeaUsher for review.

IdeaUsher or his representative will have Seven business days from the date of delivery of any document that is a deliverable to review it and request any changes.  If Ashtam Singh does not receive notification of any required changes within this period, the document will be deemed to have been accepted without modification and will be reissued as a final copy.

If Ashtam Singh is notified by IdeaUsher, within the above time frame, of any changes required, Ashtam Singh will within two business days of such notification implement those changes as have been agreed between the parties. A final copy of the document will then be submitted to IdeaUsher.

## Assumptions
* General
    * All documentation created for this project will be available in hard copy and electronic format.
    * Any modifications to the scope of work will be handled through a change control process and will be agreed to by both parties.

* Commercial
    * Additional costs may be incurred where any delay not under the control of Ashtam Singh that causes his personnel to not fulfil their scheduled tasks.
    * IdeaUsher will be available at the time of completion of the build phase so that all documentation can be accepted and signed.
    * Additional costs may be incurred where any work scheduled to be undertaken by Ashtam Singh is postponed by IdeaUsher after 24 hours of its commencement.
    * All changes to the schedule or technical requirements must be provided to Ashtam Singh in written format. Email is included as written format. Receipt of all                     correspondence should be confirmed by phone wherever possible.
